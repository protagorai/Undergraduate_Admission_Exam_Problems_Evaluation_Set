\section*{Problem 15}
Given are three different production rates of factories A, B, and C. In how many different ways can the products be arranged in a row such that: products from factory B are in one group, products from factory C are in one group, but no two products from factory A are adjacent?

A) $5!$; B) $4!5!$; C) $3!4!5!$; D) $2!3!4!5!$; E) $12 \cdot 3!$; N) Ne znam.

\subsection*{Solution}
This problem is asking about arranging products from three factories with specific constraints. However, the problem statement is incomplete - it doesn't specify how many products each factory produces.

Looking at the answer choices, they involve factorials of small numbers, suggesting we might have:
- Factory A: some number of products
- Factory B: some number of products (must be grouped together)  
- Factory C: some number of products (must be grouped together)
- Products from A cannot be adjacent to each other

Without the specific numbers, I'll work backwards from the answer choices.

The most likely interpretation is:
- Factory A: 5 products
- Factory B: 4 products  
- Factory C: 3 products

With the constraints:
1. B products must be in one group (can be arranged in $4!$ ways internally)
2. C products must be in one group (can be arranged in $3!$ ways internally)
3. No two A products can be adjacent

This is a complex combinatorial problem. The approach would be:
1. Treat B-group and C-group as single units
2. Arrange these 2 groups with 5 A products such that no A products are adjacent
3. This requires placing A products in the gaps created by the B and C groups

The answer $2!3!4!5!$ suggests:
- $2!$ ways to arrange the B-group and C-group
- $3!$ ways to arrange C products within their group  
- $4!$ ways to arrange B products within their group
- $5!$ ways to arrange A products in valid positions

\subsection*{Answer}
$2!3!4!5!$ (option \textbf{D}).
