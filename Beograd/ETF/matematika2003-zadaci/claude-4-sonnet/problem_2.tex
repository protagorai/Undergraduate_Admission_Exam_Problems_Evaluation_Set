\section*{Problem 2}
The equation $x - \frac{7}{x-3} = 3 - \frac{7}{x-3}$:

A) has infinitely many real solutions; B) has no solution; C) has exactly one real solution; D) has exactly two real solutions; E) has exactly two non-real solutions; N) Ne znam.

\subsection*{Solution}
Starting with the equation:
\[
x - \frac{7}{x-3} = 3 - \frac{7}{x-3}
\]

We can add $\frac{7}{x-3}$ to both sides:
\[
x = 3
\]

However, we must check if this solution is valid. If $x = 3$, then the original equation contains the term $\frac{7}{x-3} = \frac{7}{3-3} = \frac{7}{0}$, which is undefined.

Therefore, $x = 3$ is not a valid solution, and the equation has no solution.

\subsection*{Answer}
The equation has no solution (option \textbf{B}).
