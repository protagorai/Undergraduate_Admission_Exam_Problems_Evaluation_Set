\section*{Problem 17}
On a shelf there are $5$ English, $7$ Spanish, and $8$ French books, all distinct.
In how many ways can they be arranged if all French books must be consecutive?

\subsection*{Solution}
Treat the $8$ French books as one block. Then we arrange
\[
5+7=12
\]
other distinct books together with this one block, i.e. $13$ distinct items in total.
They can be arranged in $13!$ ways, and inside the French block the $8$ books can be permuted in $8!$ ways.
Thus the total number of arrangements is
\[
13!\cdot 8!.
\]

\subsection*{Answer}
$13!\cdot 8!$ (option \textbf{A}).
