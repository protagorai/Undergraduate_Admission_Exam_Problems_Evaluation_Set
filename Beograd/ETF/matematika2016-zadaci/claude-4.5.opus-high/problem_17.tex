\section*{Problem 17}
On a shelf there are 5 books in English, 7 in Spanish, and 8 in French. All books are mutually different. In how many ways can we arrange the books if all books written in French must be next to each other?

\subsection*{Solution}
Total books: $5 + 7 + 8 = 20$ books.

If all 8 French books must be adjacent (next to each other), we treat them as a single ``super-book'' or block.

This gives us: 5 English books + 7 Spanish books + 1 French block = 13 objects to arrange.

\textbf{Step 1:} Arrange the 13 objects (5 English + 7 Spanish + 1 French block).

Number of ways = $13!$

\textbf{Step 2:} Within the French block, the 8 French books can be arranged among themselves.

Number of ways = $8!$

\textbf{Total arrangements:} $13! \cdot 8!$

Looking at the answer options:
- (A) $13! \cdot 8!$
- (B) $13 \cdot 8!$
- (C) $13 \cdot \binom{12}{5} + 7! \cdot 8!$
- (D) $\binom{20}{7} \cdot \binom{13}{8} \cdot 5!$
- (E) None of the above

The answer is $13! \cdot 8!$, which matches option (A).

\subsection*{Answer}
$13! \cdot 8!$ (option \textbf{A}).
