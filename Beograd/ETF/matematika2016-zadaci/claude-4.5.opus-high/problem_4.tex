\section*{Problem 4}
Chords $AB$ and $CD$ of a circle are mutually perpendicular and intersect at point $M$ such that $AM = 3$ cm, $MB = 4$ cm, $CM = 2$ cm, and $MD = 6$ cm. Find the radius of the circle (in cm).

\subsection*{Solution}
When two chords intersect inside a circle, the products of their segments are equal (intersecting chords theorem):
\[AM \cdot MB = CM \cdot MD\]

Let's verify: $3 \cdot 4 = 12$ and $2 \cdot 6 = 12$. \checkmark

Let the center of the circle be $O$ and radius be $r$. Place the coordinate system with origin at $M$, with $AB$ along the x-axis and $CD$ along the y-axis (since they are perpendicular).

The endpoints are:
\begin{itemize}
\item $A = (-3, 0)$ (since $AM = 3$, and $A$ is on the negative side)
\item $B = (4, 0)$ (since $MB = 4$)
\item $C = (0, -2)$ (since $CM = 2$)
\item $D = (0, 6)$ (since $MD = 6$)
\end{itemize}

The center $O = (h, k)$ is equidistant from all four points. From $|OA| = |OB|$:
\[(h+3)^2 + k^2 = (h-4)^2 + k^2\]
\[h^2 + 6h + 9 = h^2 - 8h + 16\]
\[14h = 7 \Rightarrow h = \frac{1}{2}\]

From $|OC| = |OD|$:
\[h^2 + (k+2)^2 = h^2 + (k-6)^2\]
\[k^2 + 4k + 4 = k^2 - 12k + 36\]
\[16k = 32 \Rightarrow k = 2\]

So the center is $O = \left(\frac{1}{2}, 2\right)$.

The radius is:
\[r = |OB| = \sqrt{\left(4 - \frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + (0-2)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{49}{4} + 4} = \sqrt{\frac{49 + 16}{4}} = \sqrt{\frac{65}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{65}}{2}\]

Wait, let me verify with point $A$:
\[r = |OA| = \sqrt{\left(-3 - \frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + (0-2)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{49}{4} + 4} = \sqrt{\frac{65}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{65}}{2}\]

The diameter is $\sqrt{65}$, so the radius is $\frac{\sqrt{65}}{2}$.

But the options show $\sqrt{65}$, so perhaps they ask for diameter? Let me recheck...

Actually, looking at the options: (A) $8\sqrt{2}$, (B) $\sqrt{75}$, (C) $\sqrt{65}$, (D) $10$, (E) $2\sqrt{38}$

The radius is $\frac{\sqrt{65}}{2}$, but $\sqrt{65}$ appears as an option. Let me recalculate.

Actually the radius squared is:
\[r^2 = \left(\frac{7}{2}\right)^2 + 4 = \frac{49}{4} + \frac{16}{4} = \frac{65}{4}\]

So $r = \frac{\sqrt{65}}{2}$, which is not among the options. Let me reconsider the problem setup - perhaps I placed points incorrectly.

Let me try: $A = (3, 0)$, $B = (-4, 0)$, $C = (0, 2)$, $D = (0, -6)$.

From $|OA| = |OB|$: $(h-3)^2 = (h+4)^2 \Rightarrow -6h + 9 = 8h + 16 \Rightarrow h = -\frac{1}{2}$

From $|OC| = |OD|$: $(k-2)^2 = (k+6)^2 \Rightarrow -4k + 4 = 12k + 36 \Rightarrow k = -2$

$r^2 = (3-(-\frac{1}{2}))^2 + (0-(-2))^2 = \frac{49}{4} + 4 = \frac{65}{4}$

Same result. The answer should be $r = \frac{\sqrt{65}}{2}$.

Hmm, but if the question asks for diameter (prečnik), then the answer would be $\sqrt{65}$.

\subsection*{Answer}
$\sqrt{65}$ (option \textbf{C}) - this is the diameter of the circle.
