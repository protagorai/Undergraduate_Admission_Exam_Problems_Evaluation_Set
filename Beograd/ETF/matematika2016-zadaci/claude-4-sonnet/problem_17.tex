\section*{Problem 17}
On a shelf there are 5 books in English, 7 in Spanish and 8 in French. All books are different. In how many ways can the books be arranged if all books written in French must be together?

\subsection*{Solution}
We need to arrange 20 books total (5 + 7 + 8 = 20) with the constraint that all 8 French books must be together.

We can treat the 8 French books as a single unit. So we have:
- 1 unit of French books
- 5 English books  
- 7 Spanish books

This gives us 13 objects to arrange: 1 + 5 + 7 = 13.

These 13 objects can be arranged in $13!$ ways.

Within the French unit, the 8 French books can be arranged among themselves in $8!$ ways.

Therefore, the total number of arrangements is:
\[
13! \times 8!
\]

Let's calculate:
\[
13! = 6,227,020,800
\]
\[
8! = 40,320
\]
\[
13! \times 8! = 6,227,020,800 \times 40,320 = 251,133,798,400,000
\]

However, looking at the answer choices, they seem to be in a different format. Let me reconsider.

The answer choices suggest we should express this as a combination or permutation formula.

We have $13! \times 8!$.

Looking at the options:
- Option A: $13! \cdot 8!$
- Option B: $13 \cdot 8!$  
- Option C: $13 \cdot \binom{12}{5} + 7! \cdot 8!$
- Option D: $\binom{20}{7} \cdot \binom{13}{8} \cdot 5!$

Option A matches our calculation exactly: $13! \cdot 8!$.

\subsection*{Answer}
$13! \cdot 8!$ (option \textbf{A}).
