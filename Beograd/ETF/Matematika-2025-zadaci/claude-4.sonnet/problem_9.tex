\section*{Problem 9}
Find the set of all real solutions to $\sqrt{x+3} - 4\sqrt{x-1} + \sqrt{x+3} + 4\sqrt{x-1} \geq 4$ for $-\infty < a < b < c < \infty$.

\subsection*{Solution}
Let's simplify the left side of the inequality:
\[
\sqrt{x+3} - 4\sqrt{x-1} + \sqrt{x+3} + 4\sqrt{x-1} = 2\sqrt{x+3}
\]

So our inequality becomes:
\[
2\sqrt{x+3} \geq 4
\]

Dividing by 2:
\[
\sqrt{x+3} \geq 2
\]

For this to be defined, we need $x + 3 \geq 0$, so $x \geq -3$.

Also, from the original expression, we need $x - 1 \geq 0$, so $x \geq 1$.

The more restrictive condition is $x \geq 1$.

Now, squaring both sides of $\sqrt{x+3} \geq 2$ (which is valid since both sides are non-negative):
\[
x + 3 \geq 4
\]
\[
x \geq 1
\]

So the solution is $x \geq 1$, which can be written as $[1, +\infty)$.

Looking at the answer choices, this corresponds to option (A) $[a, +\infty)$ where $a = 1$.

But wait, let me double-check the original problem statement. The inequality seems to have some parameters $a$, $b$, $c$ mentioned, but they don't appear in the actual inequality. Let me re-read...

The problem asks for the set where $-\infty < a < b < c < \infty$, which suggests we're looking for an interval. Given our solution $[1, +\infty)$, this would correspond to option (A) $[a, +\infty)$.

Actually, looking more carefully at the answer options, they seem to involve the parameters $a$, $b$, $c$. Let me check if there's a different interpretation.

Looking at the options:
(A) $[a, +\infty)$
(B) $(-\infty, a] \cup (b, +\infty)$
(C) $(a, b) \cup \{c\}$
(D) $(-\infty, a] \cup [b, c]$
(E) $[a, b] \cup [c, +\infty)$

Since our solution is $[1, +\infty)$, this matches the form of option (A).

\subsection*{Answer}
$[a, +\infty)$ (option \textbf{A}).
