\section*{Problem 2}
If $x$ and $y$ are real numbers for which $2x - 3y = 7$, then the value of the expression $\frac{4^x}{8^y}$ equals:

\subsection*{Solution}
First, let's express both $4^x$ and $8^y$ in terms of powers of 2:
\[
4^x = (2^2)^x = 2^{2x}
\]
\[
8^y = (2^3)^y = 2^{3y}
\]

Therefore:
\[
\frac{4^x}{8^y} = \frac{2^{2x}}{2^{3y}} = 2^{2x - 3y}
\]

Given that $2x - 3y = 7$, we have:
\[
\frac{4^x}{8^y} = 2^7 = 128
\]

However, 128 is not among the given options. Let me check the options again from the image:
(A) $2^7$ (B) $\frac{1}{27}$ (C) $4^1$ (D) $8^2$ (E) Cannot be determined based on the given data

Looking at the options, we see that (A) is $2^7 = 128$, which matches our calculation.

\subsection*{Answer}
$2^7$ (option \textbf{A}).
