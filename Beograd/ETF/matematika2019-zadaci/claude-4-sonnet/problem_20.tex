\section*{Problem 20}
In the Cartesian coordinate system, points $A(2,1)$ and $B(4,3)$ are given. If $C$ is a point on the x-axis such that the sum $AC + BC$ is minimal, then the point $C$ equals:

\subsection*{Solution}
We need to find point $C(c,0)$ on the x-axis that minimizes $AC + BC$.

To minimize the sum of distances from two points to a point on a line, we use the reflection principle. We reflect one point across the line and find where the line connecting the reflected point to the other point intersects the given line.

Let's reflect point $A(2,1)$ across the x-axis to get $A'(2,-1)$.

The minimum value of $AC + BC$ equals $A'B$ (the distance from the reflected point to $B$), and this minimum is achieved when $C$ lies on the line segment $A'B$.

The line through $A'(2,-1)$ and $B(4,3)$ has slope:
$m = \frac{3 - (-1)}{4 - 2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2$

The equation of line $A'B$ is:
$y - 3 = 2(x - 4)$
$y - 3 = 2x - 8$
$y = 2x - 5$

To find where this line intersects the x-axis, we set $y = 0$:
$0 = 2x - 5$
$2x = 5$
$x = \frac{5}{2}$

Therefore, $C = \left(\frac{5}{2}, 0\right)$.

Let's verify this makes sense by checking that $A$, $C$, and $B'$ (reflection of $B$ across x-axis) are collinear, which would give the same result:

$B'(4,-3)$ and line through $A(2,1)$ and $B'(4,-3)$:
Slope: $\frac{-3-1}{4-2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2$
Equation: $y - 1 = -2(x - 2)$, so $y = -2x + 5$
Setting $y = 0$: $0 = -2x + 5$, so $x = \frac{5}{2}$ ✓

Both methods give the same answer: $C = \left(\frac{5}{2}, 0\right)$.

\subsection*{Answer}
$\left(\frac{5}{2}, 0\right)$ (option \textbf{D}).
