\section*{Problem 19}
Find the number of ways to arrange $n$ zeros and $k$ ones in a row such that no two ones are adjacent, given $k \leq n + 1$.

\subsection*{Solution}
We need to place $k$ ones among $n$ zeros such that no two ones are adjacent.

First, arrange the $n$ zeros in a row. This creates $n + 1$ possible positions for the ones (before the first zero, between consecutive zeros, and after the last zero):
\[
\_ \, 0 \, \_ \, 0 \, \_ \, 0 \, \_ \, \cdots \, \_ \, 0 \, \_
\]

There are $n + 1$ gaps (positions) where we can place ones.

We need to choose $k$ of these $n + 1$ positions to place the ones (at most one in each position to ensure no two ones are adjacent).

The number of ways to do this is:
\[
\binom{n+1}{k}
\]

\subsection*{Answer}
$\binom{n+1}{k}$ (option \textbf{A}).
