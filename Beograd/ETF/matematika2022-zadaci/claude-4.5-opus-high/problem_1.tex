\section*{Problem 1}
The price of a computer was 100000 dinars, then it was raised by 25 percent. After that, the new price was discounted by 20 percent. The final price is:

(A) 90000 \quad (B) 96000 \quad (C) 120000 \quad (D) 105000 \quad (E) 100000

\subsection*{Solution}
Let the initial price be $P_0 = 100000$ dinars.

\textbf{Step 1:} After a 25\% increase:
\[
P_1 = P_0 \times 1.25 = 100000 \times 1.25 = 125000 \text{ dinars}
\]

\textbf{Step 2:} After a 20\% discount on the new price:
\[
P_2 = P_1 \times 0.80 = 125000 \times 0.80 = 100000 \text{ dinars}
\]

Alternatively, we can compute this in one step:
\[
P_2 = P_0 \times 1.25 \times 0.80 = P_0 \times 1.00 = P_0 = 100000
\]

\subsection*{Answer}
$100000$ (option \textbf{E}).
