\section*{Problem 19}
Given points $A(2, 2)$, $A'(-2, -2)$, $B(4, -4)$, and $B'(-4, 4)$. Lines $AA'$ and $BB'$ are axes of an ellipse $\mathcal{E}$. If $y_0 > 0$ and point $Y(0, y_0)$ is the intersection of the $y$-axis and the ellipse, find $y_0$.

\subsection*{Solution}
First, let's find the equations of lines $AA'$ and $BB'$.

Line $AA'$ passes through $A(2, 2)$ and $A'(-2, -2)$:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{-2 - 2}{-2 - 2} = \frac{-4}{-4} = 1
\]
Equation: $y = x$ (passes through origin with slope 1)

Line $BB'$ passes through $B(4, -4)$ and $B'(-4, 4)$:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{4 - (-4)}{-4 - 4} = \frac{8}{-8} = -1
\]
Equation: $y = -x$ (passes through origin with slope -1)

The center of the ellipse is at the intersection of the axes, which is the origin $(0, 0)$.

The axes of the ellipse are $y = x$ and $y = -x$, which are perpendicular (as expected for an ellipse).

The semi-axis lengths:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Along $y = x$: distance from center to $A$ (or $A'$) is $\sqrt{2^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2}$
    \item Along $y = -x$: distance from center to $B$ (or $B'$) is $\sqrt{4^2 + (-4)^2} = \sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}$
\end{itemize}

So $a = 4\sqrt{2}$ (semi-major axis along $y = -x$) and $b = 2\sqrt{2}$ (semi-minor axis along $y = x$).

The ellipse equation in the rotated coordinate system (where the axes are along the principal axes) would be:
\[
\frac{u^2}{(4\sqrt{2})^2} + \frac{v^2}{(2\sqrt{2})^2} = 1
\]
where $u$ is along $y = -x$ and $v$ is along $y = x$.

The rotation from $(x, y)$ to $(u, v)$ by $45°$:
\[
u = \frac{x + y}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad v = \frac{-x + y}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

Wait, let me reconsider. The axis along $y = x$ corresponds to direction $(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})$.

For point $(0, y_0)$ on the $y$-axis:
\[
u = \frac{0 + y_0}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{y_0}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad v = \frac{0 + y_0}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{y_0}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

Hmm, let me redo the rotation. If $y = -x$ is one axis and $y = x$ is the other:

Unit vector along $y = -x$: $\mathbf{e}_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1, -1)$
Unit vector along $y = x$: $\mathbf{e}_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1, 1)$

For point $(x, y)$:
\[
u = (x, y) \cdot \mathbf{e}_1 = \frac{x - y}{\sqrt{2}}
\]
\[
v = (x, y) \cdot \mathbf{e}_2 = \frac{x + y}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

The ellipse equation:
\[
\frac{u^2}{32} + \frac{v^2}{8} = 1
\]

For point $(0, y_0)$:
\[
u = \frac{0 - y_0}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{-y_0}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad v = \frac{0 + y_0}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{y_0}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

Substituting:
\[
\frac{y_0^2/2}{32} + \frac{y_0^2/2}{8} = 1
\]
\[
\frac{y_0^2}{64} + \frac{y_0^2}{16} = 1
\]
\[
\frac{y_0^2}{64} + \frac{4y_0^2}{64} = 1
\]
\[
\frac{5y_0^2}{64} = 1
\]
\[
y_0^2 = \frac{64}{5}
\]
\[
y_0 = \frac{8}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{8\sqrt{5}}{5}
\]

\subsection*{Answer}
$\frac{8}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{8\sqrt{5}}{5}$ (option \textbf{A}).
