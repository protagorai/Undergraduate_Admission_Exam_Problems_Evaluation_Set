\section*{Problem 15}
Find the number of all real solutions of the equation $\sin^2 x + \frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \sin x$.

\subsection*{Solution}
Let $t = \sin x$. The equation becomes:
\[
t^2 + \frac{1}{t^2} = t
\]

For this equation to make sense, we need $t \neq 0$, so $\sin x \neq 0$.

Multiply both sides by $t^2$:
\[
t^4 + 1 = t^3
\]
\[
t^4 - t^3 + 1 = 0
\]

Let's analyze this polynomial $f(t) = t^4 - t^3 + 1$.

Taking the derivative: $f'(t) = 4t^3 - 3t^2 = t^2(4t - 3)$.

Critical points: $t = 0$ and $t = \frac{3}{4}$.

Evaluating:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $f(0) = 1 > 0$
    \item $f\left(\frac{3}{4}\right) = \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^4 - \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^3 + 1 = \frac{81}{256} - \frac{27}{64} + 1 = \frac{81}{256} - \frac{108}{256} + \frac{256}{256} = \frac{229}{256} > 0$
\end{itemize}

Also:
\begin{itemize}
    \item As $t \to +\infty$: $f(t) \to +\infty$
    \item As $t \to -\infty$: $f(t) \to +\infty$
    \item $f(-1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 > 0$
    \item $f(1) = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1 > 0$
\end{itemize}

Since $f(t) > 0$ at all critical points and the function goes to $+\infty$ at both ends, and checking $f(t)$ for various values shows it's always positive, the equation $t^4 - t^3 + 1 = 0$ has no real solutions.

Let's verify by checking the discriminant or factoring attempts...

Actually, let's check if the polynomial can be factored. We can try to factor as $(t^2 + at + 1)(t^2 + bt + 1)$ or similar forms.

$t^4 - t^3 + 1 = (t^2 + at + 1)(t^2 + bt + 1)$ would give:
$t^4 + (a+b)t^3 + (2 + ab)t^2 + (a+b)t + 1$

Comparing: $a + b = -1$ and $a + b = 0$ (from coefficient of $t$), which is contradictory.

Let's try $(t^2 + at + b)(t^2 + ct + d)$ with $bd = 1$.

Since $f(t) > 0$ for all tested values and has no real roots, the equation $\sin^2 x + \frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \sin x$ has no real solutions.

Note also that for $|\sin x| \leq 1$, we have $\sin^2 x \leq 1$, so $\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} \geq 1$. Thus:
\[
\sin^2 x + \frac{1}{\sin^2 x} \geq 2
\]
(by AM-GM inequality, with equality when $\sin^2 x = 1$).

But $|\sin x| \leq 1$, so the right side satisfies $\sin x \leq 1 < 2$.

Therefore, the left side is always $\geq 2$ while the right side is always $\leq 1$, making the equation impossible.

\subsection*{Answer}
$0$ (option \textbf{A}).
