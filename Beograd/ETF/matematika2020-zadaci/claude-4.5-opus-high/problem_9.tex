\section*{Problem 9}
Figure $F_1$ is obtained from an equilateral triangle with area $P$ by removing the triangle whose vertices are the midpoints of the sides of the original triangle. Figure $F_1$ consists of 3 triangles. Figure $F_2$ is obtained by removing from figure $F_1$ three triangles whose vertices are the midpoints of the sides of the three triangles that make up figure $F_1$. Figure $F_2$ consists of 9 triangles. Figure $F_{n+1}$ is obtained by removing from figure $F_n$ the $3^n$ triangles whose vertices are the midpoints of the sides of the $3^n$ triangles that make up figure $F_n$. Find the sum of areas of all figures $F_n$, $n \in \mathbb{N}$, obtained in this way.

\subsection*{Solution}
Let's analyze the area of each figure $F_n$.

Starting with an equilateral triangle of area $P$:

\textbf{Figure $F_1$:} We remove the middle triangle (formed by connecting midpoints). This middle triangle has area $\frac{P}{4}$ (since connecting midpoints divides the triangle into 4 congruent triangles).

Area of $F_1 = P - \frac{P}{4} = \frac{3P}{4}$

\textbf{Figure $F_2$:} $F_1$ consists of 3 triangles, each with area $\frac{P}{4}$. From each, we remove a triangle of area $\frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{P}{4} = \frac{P}{16}$.

Total removed: $3 \cdot \frac{P}{16} = \frac{3P}{16}$

Area of $F_2 = \frac{3P}{4} - \frac{3P}{16} = \frac{12P - 3P}{16} = \frac{9P}{16} = \frac{3^2 P}{4^2}$

\textbf{Pattern:} By induction, we can show that:
\[
\text{Area of } F_n = \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^n P
\]

The sum of areas of all figures $F_n$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ is:
\[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^n P = P \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^n
\]

This is a geometric series with first term $a = \frac{3}{4}$ and ratio $r = \frac{3}{4}$:
\[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^n = \frac{\frac{3}{4}}{1 - \frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\frac{3}{4}}{\frac{1}{4}} = 3
\]

Therefore, the sum of all areas is:
\[
P \cdot 3 = 3P
\]

\subsection*{Answer}
$3P$ (option \textbf{D}).
