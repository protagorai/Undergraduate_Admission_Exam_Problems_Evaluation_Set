\section*{Problem 14}
In how many ways can we form a five-member committee from 2 mathematicians and 8 engineers such that exactly one mathematician is on the committee?

\subsection*{Solution}
We need to choose exactly 1 mathematician from 2 mathematicians, and exactly 4 engineers from 8 engineers.

\textbf{Number of ways to choose 1 mathematician from 2:}
\[
\binom{2}{1} = 2
\]

\textbf{Number of ways to choose 4 engineers from 8:}
\[
\binom{8}{4} = \frac{8!}{4! \cdot 4!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{1680}{24} = 70
\]

\textbf{Total number of ways:}
\[
\binom{2}{1} \times \binom{8}{4} = 2 \times 70 = 140
\]

\subsection*{Answer}
\textbf{(E)} 140
