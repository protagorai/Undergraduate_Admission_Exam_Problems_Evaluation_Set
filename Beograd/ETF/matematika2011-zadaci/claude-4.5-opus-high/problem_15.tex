\section*{Problem 15}
Find the set of all real solutions of the equation 
\[
\sqrt{\sin^2 x + \frac{1}{2}} + \sqrt{\cos^2 x + \frac{1}{2}} = 2
\]
on the interval $[0, 2\pi]$.

\subsection*{Solution}
Let $u = \sin^2 x$ and $v = \cos^2 x$. We know that $u + v = 1$, so $v = 1 - u$.

The equation becomes:
\[
\sqrt{u + \frac{1}{2}} + \sqrt{(1-u) + \frac{1}{2}} = 2
\]
\[
\sqrt{u + \frac{1}{2}} + \sqrt{\frac{3}{2} - u} = 2
\]

Let $f(u) = \sqrt{u + \frac{1}{2}} + \sqrt{\frac{3}{2} - u}$ where $0 \leq u \leq 1$ (since $u = \sin^2 x$).

To find the maximum of $f(u)$, we can use calculus or note that by Cauchy-Schwarz:
\[
\left(\sqrt{u + \frac{1}{2}} + \sqrt{\frac{3}{2} - u}\right)^2 \leq 2\left((u + \frac{1}{2}) + (\frac{3}{2} - u)\right) = 2 \cdot 2 = 4
\]

So $f(u) \leq 2$, with equality when $u + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2} - u$, i.e., $2u = 1$, so $u = \frac{1}{2}$.

When $u = \sin^2 x = \frac{1}{2}$, we have $|\sin x| = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, which means:
\[
x = \frac{\pi}{4}, \frac{3\pi}{4}, \frac{5\pi}{4}, \frac{7\pi}{4}
\]

Let's verify: When $\sin^2 x = \frac{1}{2}$, $\cos^2 x = \frac{1}{2}$:
\[
\sqrt{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}} + \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{1} + \sqrt{1} = 2 \checkmark
\]

The solution set is $\left\{\frac{\pi}{4}, \frac{3\pi}{4}, \frac{5\pi}{4}, \frac{7\pi}{4}\right\}$.

This can be written as $x = \frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{k\pi}{2}$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, 3$, or equivalently, the solutions are at $x$ where $\sin x = \pm\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ and $\cos x = \pm\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$.

Since the problem asks about the interval $[0, 2\pi]$ and the equation has solutions only at these 4 specific points, and none of the given options (A) $\pi$, (B) $2\pi$, (C) $3\pi$, (D) $4\pi$ match a single solution, this refers to the cardinality or a sum. Given the options involve multiples of $\pi$, the answer is likely asking about something else.

Looking at the options again: they seem to be single values. The equation $= 2$ is satisfied when $\sin^2 x = \cos^2 x = \frac{1}{2}$, which happens at $x = \frac{\pi}{4}, \frac{3\pi}{4}, \frac{5\pi}{4}, \frac{7\pi}{4}$.

Given option (E) says "None of the offered answers", and indeed the solution set is not a single value but four discrete points, the answer is \textbf{(E)}.

\subsection*{Answer}
\textbf{(E)} Nijedan od ponuđenih odgovora (None of the offered answers)
