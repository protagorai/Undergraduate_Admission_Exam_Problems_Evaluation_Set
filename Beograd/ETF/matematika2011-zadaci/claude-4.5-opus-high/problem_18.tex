\section*{Problem 18}
The base of a right square pyramid is a rectangle with diagonal $d$, and the angle $\alpha$ is between the diagonals. The lateral edges form angle $\beta$ with the base. Find the volume of the pyramid.

\subsection*{Solution}
Let the rectangular base have sides $a$ and $b$. The diagonal is $d$, so:
\[
a^2 + b^2 = d^2
\]

The angle between the diagonals is $\alpha$. In a rectangle, the diagonals bisect each other. If we place the center at the origin, the diagonals make angles with each other. The angle $\alpha$ between diagonals satisfies:
\[
\cos\alpha = \frac{a^2 - b^2}{d^2} \quad \text{or} \quad \sin\alpha = \frac{2ab}{d^2}
\]

Actually, using the formula for the angle between diagonals in a rectangle:
The diagonals have length $d$ and bisect each other. The angle between them satisfies:
\[
\sin\alpha = \frac{2ab}{d^2}
\]

The area of the base is:
\[
S = ab = \frac{d^2 \sin\alpha}{2}
\]

The apex of the pyramid is directly above the center of the rectangle. The distance from the center to a vertex (where the lateral edge meets the base) is $\frac{d}{2}$.

If $h$ is the height of the pyramid and the lateral edge makes angle $\beta$ with the base:
\[
\tan\beta = \frac{h}{d/2} = \frac{2h}{d}
\]

So $h = \frac{d\tan\beta}{2}$.

The volume is:
\[
V = \frac{1}{3} \cdot S \cdot h = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{d^2\sin\alpha}{2} \cdot \frac{d\tan\beta}{2} = \frac{d^3 \sin\alpha \tan\beta}{12}
\]

Since $\tan\beta = \frac{\sin\beta}{\cos\beta}$:
\[
V = \frac{d^3}{12} \sin\alpha \cdot \frac{\sin\beta}{\cos\beta} = \frac{d^3}{12} \sin\alpha \tan\beta
\]

Looking at the options, they use $\text{ctg}\beta = \cot\beta$ and $\text{tg}\beta = \tan\beta$. Option (B) is $\frac{d^3}{12}\sin\alpha\tan\beta$.

\subsection*{Answer}
\textbf{(B)} $\displaystyle\frac{d^3}{12}\sin\alpha\,\text{tg}\,\beta$
