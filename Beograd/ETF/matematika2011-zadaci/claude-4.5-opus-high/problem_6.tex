\section*{Problem 6}
The bases of an isosceles trapezoid are 15 cm and 5 cm, and the legs are 13 cm. Find its height (in cm).

\subsection*{Solution}
Let the trapezoid have parallel bases $a = 15$ cm and $b = 5$ cm, with legs of length $c = 13$ cm.

When we drop perpendiculars from the endpoints of the shorter base to the longer base, we create a rectangle in the middle and two congruent right triangles on the sides.

The horizontal distance from each foot of the perpendicular to the nearest endpoint of the longer base is:
\[
\frac{a - b}{2} = \frac{15 - 5}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ cm}
\]

In each right triangle, the hypotenuse is the leg of the trapezoid (13 cm), and one leg is 5 cm. Using the Pythagorean theorem to find the height $h$:
\[
h^2 + 5^2 = 13^2
\]
\[
h^2 + 25 = 169
\]
\[
h^2 = 144
\]
\[
h = 12 \text{ cm}
\]

\subsection*{Answer}
\textbf{(D)} 12
