\section*{Problem 5}
A triangle is cut into two equal parts by a line parallel to one of its sides. If $a$ is the side of the triangle, then the side of the smaller triangle lying on the given line is:

\subsection*{Solution}
When a triangle is cut by a line parallel to one of its sides, the resulting smaller triangle is similar to the original triangle.

If the triangle is cut into two equal parts by area, then:
\[
\frac{\text{Area of smaller triangle}}{\text{Area of original triangle}} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of their areas equals the square of the ratio of corresponding sides:
\[
\frac{\text{Area of smaller triangle}}{\text{Area of original triangle}} = \left(\frac{\text{side of smaller triangle}}{\text{side of original triangle}}\right)^2
\]

Let $x$ be the side of the smaller triangle corresponding to side $a$ of the original triangle:
\[
\frac{1}{2} = \left(\frac{x}{a}\right)^2
\]

Solving for $x$:
\[
\frac{x}{a} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

Therefore:
\[
x = a \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{a\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

\subsection*{Answer}
$\frac{a\sqrt{2}}{2}$ (option \textbf{D}).
