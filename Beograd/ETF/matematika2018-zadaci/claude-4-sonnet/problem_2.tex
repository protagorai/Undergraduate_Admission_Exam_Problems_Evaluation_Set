\section*{Problem 2}
The price of a book first increased by 20\%, then the new price increased by 35\%. What is the total percentage increase?

\subsection*{Solution}
Let the original price be $P$.

After the first increase of 20\%:
\[
P_1 = P + 0.20P = 1.20P
\]

After the second increase of 35\% on the new price:
\[
P_2 = P_1 + 0.35P_1 = 1.35P_1 = 1.35 \cdot 1.20P = 1.62P
\]

The total increase is:
\[
P_2 - P = 1.62P - P = 0.62P
\]

The percentage increase is:
\[
\frac{0.62P}{P} \times 100\% = 62\%
\]

\subsection*{Answer}
62\% (option \textbf{C}).
