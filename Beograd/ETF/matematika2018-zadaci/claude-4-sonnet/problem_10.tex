\section*{Problem 10}
The value of the real parameter $\alpha$ for which the system of equations $2x - 5y = 0$, $3x - \alpha y = 0$ has more than one solution is:

\subsection*{Solution}
For a homogeneous system of linear equations to have more than one solution (infinitely many solutions), the coefficient matrix must be singular (determinant equals zero) and the equations must be dependent.

The system is:
\begin{align}
2x - 5y &= 0\\
3x - \alpha y &= 0
\end{align}

The coefficient matrix is:
\[
A = \begin{pmatrix}
2 & -5\\
3 & -\alpha
\end{pmatrix}
\]

For the system to have infinitely many solutions, we need:
\[
\det(A) = 2(-\alpha) - (-5)(3) = -2\alpha + 15 = 0
\]

Solving for $\alpha$:
\[
-2\alpha + 15 = 0 \Rightarrow \alpha = \frac{15}{2}
\]

Let's verify: when $\alpha = \frac{15}{2}$, the system becomes:
\begin{align}
2x - 5y &= 0\\
3x - \frac{15}{2}y &= 0
\end{align}

From the first equation: $x = \frac{5y}{2}$

Substituting into the second equation:
\[
3 \cdot \frac{5y}{2} - \frac{15}{2}y = \frac{15y}{2} - \frac{15y}{2} = 0
\]

This confirms that the equations are dependent when $\alpha = \frac{15}{2}$.

\subsection*{Answer}
$\frac{15}{2}$ (option \textbf{E}).
