\section*{Problem 13}
The base edge of a regular quadrilateral pyramid is $8 \text{ cm}$, and the center of the base is at a distance of $2 \text{ cm}$ from the lateral face. The height of the pyramid is equal to:

\subsection*{Solution}
Let $a=8$ be the base edge and $H$ be the height of the pyramid.
Let $O$ be the center of the base. The distance from $O$ to the lateral face is given as $d=2$.
Consider the cross-section containing the height $H$ and the apothem (slant height) of the lateral face $h$.
Let $M$ be the midpoint of a base edge. $OM = a/2 = 4$.
In the right triangle formed by the height $H$, apothem $h$, and segment $OM$, we have $h^2 = H^2 + OM^2 = H^2 + 16$.
The distance $d$ is the altitude from the right angle vertex $O$ to the hypotenuse $h$ in this triangle.
Using the area of the triangle or properties of right triangles:
\[ H \cdot OM = h \cdot d \]
\[ H \cdot 4 = h \cdot 2 \implies h = 2H \]
Substitute $h=2H$ into the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ (2H)^2 = H^2 + 16 \]
\[ 4H^2 = H^2 + 16 \]
\[ 3H^2 = 16 \]
\[ H^2 = \frac{16}{3} \]
\[ H = \frac{4}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3} \]

\subsection*{Answer}
$\frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3}$ (option \textbf{D}).
