\section*{Problem 2}
The price of a book was first increased by 20\%, and then the new price was increased by 35\%. The total increase in the book's price is:

\subsection*{Solution}
Let the initial price be $P$.
After the first increase of 20\%, the new price $P_1$ is:
\[ P_1 = P(1 + 0.20) = 1.20P \]
After the second increase of 35\%, the final price $P_2$ is:
\[ P_2 = P_1(1 + 0.35) = 1.20P \cdot 1.35 \]
Calculating the product:
\[ 1.20 \cdot 1.35 = 1.62 \]
So $P_2 = 1.62P$.
The total increase is $P_2 - P = 1.62P - P = 0.62P$.
Expressed as a percentage, the increase is 62\%.

\subsection*{Answer}
62\% (option \textbf{C}).
