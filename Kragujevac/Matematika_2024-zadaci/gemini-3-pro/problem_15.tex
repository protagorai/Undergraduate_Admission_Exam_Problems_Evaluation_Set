\section*{Problem 15}
In an increasing geometric sequence, the sum of the first three terms equals 26, and the sum of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th terms equals 234. Find the product of the 1st and 5th terms.

\subsection*{Solution}
Let the geometric sequence be $b_1, b_2, b_3, \dots$ with common ratio $q$.
Given:
1) $b_1 + b_2 + b_3 = 26 \implies b_1(1 + q + q^2) = 26$.
2) $b_3 + b_4 + b_5 = 234 \implies b_1 q^2 + b_1 q^3 + b_1 q^4 = 234 \implies b_1 q^2(1 + q + q^2) = 234$.

Divide equation (2) by equation (1):
\[
\frac{b_1 q^2(1 + q + q^2)}{b_1(1 + q + q^2)} = \frac{234}{26}.
\]
\[
q^2 = 9.
\]
So $q = 3$ or $q = -3$.
The problem states the sequence is "increasing".
If $q = 3$, terms are $b_1, 3b_1, 9b_1 \dots$. For this to be increasing, we need $b_1 > 0$ and $q > 1$, which fits.
If $q = -3$, the terms oscillate signs, so it's not increasing.
Thus $q = 3$.

Find $b_1$ from (1):
\[
b_1(1 + 3 + 9) = 26 \implies 13b_1 = 26 \implies b_1 = 2.
\]
The sequence is $2, 6, 18, 54, 162, \dots$
We need the product of the 1st term ($b_1$) and the 5th term ($b_5$).
$b_5 = b_1 q^4 = 2 \cdot 3^4 = 2 \cdot 81 = 162$.
Product $P = b_1 \cdot b_5 = 2 \cdot 162 = 324$.

Alternatively, $b_1 b_5 = b_1 (b_1 q^4) = (b_1 q^2)^2 = b_3^2$.
$b_3 = b_1 q^2 = 2 \cdot 9 = 18$.
$18^2 = 324$.

\subsection*{Answer}
$324$ (option \textbf{A}).
