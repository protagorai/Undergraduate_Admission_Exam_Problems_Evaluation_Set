\section*{Problem 14}
How many 6-digit numbers are there whose first three digits are even (not necessarily different) and whose last three digits are different odd numbers?

\subsection*{Solution}
A 6-digit number is of the form $d_1 d_2 d_3 d_4 d_5 d_6$.
Condition 1: First three digits ($d_1, d_2, d_3$) are even.
The set of even digits is $E = \{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\}$.
$d_1 \in \{2, 4, 6, 8\}$ (cannot be 0). There are 4 choices.
$d_2 \in E$. There are 5 choices.
$d_3 \in E$. There are 5 choices.
Total choices for the first part: $4 \times 5 \times 5 = 100$.

Condition 2: Last three digits ($d_4, d_5, d_6$) are different odd numbers.
The set of odd digits is $O = \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}$. Size is 5.
We need to choose 3 distinct digits from $O$ and arrange them in positions $d_4, d_5, d_6$.
$d_4$: 5 choices.
$d_5$: 4 choices (any except $d_4$).
$d_6$: 3 choices (any except $d_4, d_5$).
Total choices for the second part: $5 \times 4 \times 3 = 60$.

Total number of such 6-digit numbers is the product of counts for independent parts:
\[
100 \times 60 = 6000.
\]

\subsection*{Answer}
$6000$ (option \textbf{Д}).
