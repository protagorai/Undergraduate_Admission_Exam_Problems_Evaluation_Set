\section*{Problem 14}
How many six-digit numbers have the first three digits even (not necessarily distinct),
and the last three digits distinct odd digits?

\subsection*{Solution}
Even digits are $\{0,2,4,6,8\}$.
The first digit of a six-digit number cannot be $0$, so the first digit has $4$ choices: $\{2,4,6,8\}$.
The second and third digits can be any even digit, so each has $5$ choices.

Odd digits are $\{1,3,5,7,9\}$. The last three digits must be distinct odd digits, so there are
\[
5\cdot 4\cdot 3=60
\]
ways to choose them in order.

Total count:
\[
4\cdot 5\cdot 5\cdot 60=6000.
\]

\subsection*{Answer}
$6000$ (option \textbf{Д}).
