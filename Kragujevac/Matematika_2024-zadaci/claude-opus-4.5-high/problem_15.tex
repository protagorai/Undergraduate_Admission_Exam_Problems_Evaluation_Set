\section*{Problem 15 - Solution}

\textbf{Problem:} In an increasing geometric sequence, the sum of the first three terms equals 26, and the sum of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th terms equals 234. Find the product of the 1st and 5th terms.

\textbf{Solution:}

Let the first term be $a$ and the common ratio be $r$ (where $r > 1$ for increasing sequence).

\textbf{Set up equations:}

Sum of first 3 terms:
\[
a + ar + ar^2 = 26 \quad \text{...(1)}
\]

Sum of 3rd, 4th, 5th terms:
\[
ar^2 + ar^3 + ar^4 = 234 \quad \text{...(2)}
\]

\textbf{Step 1: Find $r$}

Factor equation (2):
\[
r^2(a + ar + ar^2) = 234
\]

Substitute from (1):
\[
r^2 \cdot 26 = 234
\]
\[
r^2 = \frac{234}{26} = 9
\]
\[
r = 3 \quad \text{(positive, since sequence is increasing)}
\]

\textbf{Step 2: Find $a$}

From equation (1):
\[
a(1 + 3 + 9) = 26
\]
\[
13a = 26
\]
\[
a = 2
\]

\textbf{Step 3: Find the product of 1st and 5th terms}

\begin{itemize}
\item 1st term: $a = 2$
\item 5th term: $ar^4 = 2 \cdot 3^4 = 2 \cdot 81 = 162$
\end{itemize}

Product:
\[
a \cdot ar^4 = 2 \times 162 = 324
\]

\textbf{Answer: А) 324}
